It's similar to chicken meal but made from by-products instead of muscle meat. Rendering concentrates protein (60-70% protein vs 18-20% in fresh chicken) but damages heat-sensitive nutrients like B vitamins and taurine.

In the US, people prefer boneless, skinless chicken breast, so organs, feet, necks, and heads have lower market value and are sold to pet food manufacturers at a discount. This doesn't necessarily mean by-products are low quality—many cultures prize organs for their nutritional value. The low cost reflects market demand, not inherent nutritional worth. However, the cheapness does attract manufacturers who prioritize cost-cutting over nutrition."

The pet food industry has successfully stigmatized by-products as 'fillers' or 'waste,' so premium brands avoid the term to appeal to consumers—even though many by-products (organs) are nutritionally superior to muscle meat. Instead, premium brands list specific organs like 'beef liver,' 'chicken heart,' or 'turkey gizzard' rather than using the catch-all term 'by-products.' This provides transparency and avoids the negative association, even though these named organs are technically by-products."

      <p style="margin-bottom: 12px; font-size: 15px;"><strong>The problem:</strong> "Chicken by-products" is too vague—could be nutrient-rich liver or low-value feet</p>

    <div class="article-content">
      <p>This guide explains exactly what chicken by-products are, why they're stigmatized, whether they're actually bad for dogs, and what to look for on labels.</p>

      <h2>What Are Chicken By-Products?</h2>

      <p>According to AAFCO (the organization that defines pet food ingredients), <strong>chicken by-products</strong> are:</p>

      <p><em>"Non-rendered, clean parts of slaughtered chicken such as heads, feet, viscera, free from fecal content and foreign matter except such amounts as might occur unavoidably in good processing practices."</em></p>

      <p>In simpler terms: by-products are the parts of the chicken that aren't muscle meat or skin. This includes:</p>

      <h3>What's Included in Chicken By-Products:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Organs (viscera)</strong> — Liver, heart, kidney, spleen, gizzard, lungs, intestines</li>
        <li><strong>Heads</strong> — Including brain, eyes, combs</li>
        <li><strong>Feet</strong> — Source of collagen and cartilage</li>
        <li><strong>Necks</strong> — Bone, cartilage, connective tissue</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What's NOT Included (Per AAFCO):</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Feathers</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Feces or intestinal contents</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Beaks</strong> (though heads are allowed)</li>
        <li><strong>Foreign matter</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>The key thing to understand is that <strong>"by-products" is a catch-all term</strong> that includes both highly nutritious parts (organs like liver and heart) and less valuable parts (feet, necks). You can't tell which from the label.</p>

      <h2>Are Chicken By-Products Bad for Dogs?</h2>

      <p>The short answer: <strong>It depends entirely on which by-products are included and the quality of sourcing.</strong></p>

      <h3>Why By-Products Aren't Inherently Bad:</h3>

      <p>Many by-products are some of the most nutrient-dense foods available:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="/ingredient-analyzer/ingredients/chicken-liver/">Chicken liver</a></strong> — 50x more vitamin A than muscle meat, 3000% more B12, 12x more iron, extremely rich in folate and choline. One of the most nutrient-dense foods on the planet.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="/ingredient-analyzer/ingredients/chicken-heart/">Chicken heart</a></strong> — Rich in taurine (critical for heart health), CoQ10 (energy and antioxidant support), B vitamins, iron, and zinc.</li>
        <li><strong>Chicken kidney</strong> — High in B12, selenium, riboflavin, and protein. Supports kidney and metabolic function.</li>
        <li><strong>Chicken gizzard</strong> — Lean protein source, rich in iron, zinc, and B vitamins. Essentially a muscle (stomach muscle).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>These organs are <strong>more nutritious than plain chicken breast</strong>. Dogs in the wild eat organs first because they're instinctively drawn to nutrient density. For more on why organs are so valuable, see <a href="/blog/beef-liver-for-dogs.html">Why Beef Liver is One of the Best Things You Can Feed Your Dog</a>.</p>

      <h3>Why By-Products Can Be Problematic:</h3>

      <p>The problem isn't that by-products are bad — it's that the term lacks transparency:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Quality variation</strong> — "Chicken by-products" could mean premium liver and heart, or it could mean low-value feet and intestines. The label doesn't tell you.</li>
        <li><strong>Sourcing concerns</strong> — Some manufacturers use by-products from sick, dying, or diseased animals (material not fit for human consumption). Reputable brands don't, but the vague labeling makes it impossible to verify.</li>
        <li><strong>Marketing stigma</strong> — The pet food industry has trained consumers to view by-products as "fillers" or "waste," so brands using quality by-products often hide them under vague terminology.</li>
        <li><strong>Lack of specificity</strong> — Without knowing which parts are included, you can't evaluate nutritional value or make informed decisions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Chicken By-Products vs. Named Organs: The Transparency Problem</h2>

      <p>Here's the key distinction that matters for dog owners:</p>

      <div class="callout">

        </table>

        <p style="margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 15px;"><strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> If a manufacturer is using high-quality organs, they'll name them specifically. If they hide behind "by-products," they're likely using lower-value parts or don't want you to know what's included.</p>

      <h2>What Is Chicken By-Product Meal?</h2>

      <p>Chicken by-product meal is even less transparent than chicken by-products. It's by-products that have been <strong>rendered</strong> — cooked at high heat (240-290°F) to remove moisture and fat, then ground into a powder.</p>

      <h3>How By-Product Meal Differs from By-Products:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Chicken by-products</strong> — Fresh or frozen organs, necks, feet, etc. (non-rendered)</li>
        <li><strong>Chicken by-product meal</strong> — Rendered (heat-processed) and dried by-products</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why Rendering Matters:</h3>

      <p>Rendering concentrates protein (by-product meal is ~60-70% protein vs ~18-20% in fresh chicken), but it also:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Destroys heat-sensitive nutrients</strong> — B vitamins (especially thiamine, riboflavin), taurine, glutathione, and natural enzymes are damaged or lost at high heat</li>
        <li><strong>Reduces bioavailability</strong> — Nutrients that survive rendering are less efficiently absorbed than those in minimally processed whole foods</li>
        <li><strong>Obscures quality further</strong> — Rendering makes it even harder to know what went into the meal</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For more on how rendering affects nutrition, see <a href="/blog/what-is-meat-meal-dog-food.html">What is Meat Meal in Dog Food?</a></p>

      <h2>The Marketing Problem: Why By-Products Are Stigmatized</h2>

      <p>The pet food industry has successfully created a stigma around "by-products," positioning them as low-quality fillers that premium brands avoid. This marketing works because:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Western food culture</strong> — In the US, people don't eat organs, feet, or heads, so these parts seem "gross" or unfit for consumption</li>
        <li><strong>Premium positioning</strong> — Brands can charge more by claiming "no by-products" even though some by-products are superior to muscle meat</li>
        <li><strong>Vague terminology</strong> — The catch-all term makes it easy to lump excellent ingredients (liver) with poor ones (feet)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Reality:</h3>

      <p>Many cultures around the world prize organs for their nutritional value. In France, pâté (liver) is a delicacy. In Asia, chicken feet are valued for collagen. The "by-product = bad" narrative is a cultural bias, not a nutritional fact.</p>

      <p><strong>The actual issue</strong> is transparency. If a food contains liver — great! But call it liver, not "by-products." If it contains feet — fine, but be honest about it so consumers can decide if that's what they want.</p>

      <h2>Should You Avoid Dog Food with Chicken By-Products?</h2>

      <p>Here's how to evaluate foods with by-products:</p>

      <h3>✅ When By-Products May Be Acceptable:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Premium, trusted brand</strong> — If a brand you trust with transparent sourcing lists by-products, they may be using quality organs</li>
        <li><strong>Supplementary ingredient</strong> — By-products listed lower on the ingredient list as a minor component, alongside named proteins</li>
        <li><strong>Company provides transparency</strong> — Brand clearly states which by-products are used (some do this on their website)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>⚠️ When to Avoid By-Products:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Primary protein source</strong> — If "chicken by-products" or "chicken by-product meal" is the first or second ingredient</li>
        <li><strong>Budget or low-quality brands</strong> — Brands known for cutting costs are likely using the cheapest by-products available</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple generic by-products</strong> — Lists like "chicken by-products, meat by-products, poultry by-product meal" signal poor quality</li>
        <li><strong>No transparency</strong> — Brand won't disclose which parts are included</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>✅ Better Option: Look for Named Ingredients</h3>

      <p>Instead of accepting vague "by-products," choose foods that specify exactly what organs are included:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Named organs:</strong> "<a href="/ingredient-analyzer/ingredients/chicken-liver/">Chicken liver</a>," "<a href="/ingredient-analyzer/ingredients/chicken-heart/">chicken heart</a>," "chicken gizzard"</li>
        <li><strong>Whole prey:</strong> "<a href="/ingredient-analyzer/ingredients/chicken/">Whole chicken</a>" (includes organs naturally)</li>
        <li><strong>Organ blends:</strong> "Chicken organs" or "chicken viscera" (slightly more specific than "by-products")</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For comparison, see what to look for in <a href="/ingredient-analyzer/ingredients/meat-by-products/">generic meat by-products</a> vs. <a href="/ingredient-analyzer/ingredients/poultry-by-product-meal/">poultry by-product meal</a> vs. <a href="/ingredient-analyzer/ingredients/chicken-meal/">chicken meal</a>.</p>

      <h2>Chicken By-Products in Dog Treats</h2>

      <p>In treats, "chicken by-products" usually refers to dehydrated or freeze-dried organs, feet, or necks. The same transparency rules apply:</p>

      <h3>✅ Good By-Product Treats:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Freeze-dried chicken liver</strong> — Nutrient-dense, dogs love it, excellent training treat</li>
        <li><strong>Dehydrated chicken hearts</strong> — High in taurine, natural chew</li>
        <li><strong>Air-dried chicken gizzards</strong> — Lean protein, chewy texture</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>⚠️ Lower-Value By-Product Treats:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Chicken feet</strong> — Mostly collagen and cartilage, minimal nutritional value beyond joint support</li>
        <li><strong>Chicken necks</strong> — Bone and cartilage, some dogs enjoy as chews but not nutrient-dense</li>
        <li><strong>Generic "chicken by-products"</strong> — Unknown mix, impossible to evaluate</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Again: transparency is key. A treat labeled "freeze-dried chicken liver" is excellent. A treat labeled "chicken by-products" is concerning.</p>

      <h2>Whole-Food Organs vs. By-Products: The Watts Approach</h2>

      <p>At Watts, we don't use vague "by-products" terminology. We name exactly what organs we use:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Beef liver</strong> — The most nutrient-dense whole food available</li>
        <li><strong>Beef kidney</strong> — Rich in B12, selenium, and riboflavin</li>
        <li><strong>Beef heart</strong> — High in taurine, CoQ10, and B vitamins</li>
      </ul>

      <p>These organs are technically "by-products" under AAFCO definitions, but we don't hide behind that term. We source them from grass-fed cattle, air-dry them to preserve nutrients (no high-heat rendering), and list them clearly on our label.</p>

      <p><strong>Why transparency matters:</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>You know exactly what your dog is eating</strong> — No guessing, no vague terminology</li>
        <li><strong>We're confident in our ingredients</strong> — If we're using premium organs, why hide them behind "by-products"?</li>
        <li><strong>Minimal processing preserves nutrients</strong> — Air-drying retains 95%+ of nutrients vs rendering which destroys 30-50%</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Bottom Line on Chicken By-Products</h2>

      <p>"Chicken by-products" isn't automatically bad — some by-products (organs) are the most nutritious parts of the animal. But the term is too vague to trust.</p>

      <p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Prioritize transparency</strong> — Choose foods that name specific organs (liver, heart) rather than hiding behind "by-products"</li>
        <li><strong>Evaluate brand reputation</strong> — If a trusted brand lists by-products, research what they include. Low-quality brands likely use cheap parts.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid by-product meal</strong> — Rendered by-products lose nutrients and are even less transparent</li>
        <li><strong>Read the full ingredient list</strong> — If "chicken by-products" is the first ingredient, avoid. If it's a minor component in an otherwise high-quality food, it may be fine.</li>
        <li><strong>Consider whole-food supplementation</strong> — If your dog's food doesn't include named organs, consider adding <a href="/blog/beef-liver-for-dogs.html">whole-food organ supplements</a> to fill nutritional gaps</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The real issue isn't whether something is a by-product — it's whether the manufacturer is transparent about what they're using and committed to quality sourcing.</p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">What are chicken by-products in dog food?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">Chicken by-products are the parts of the chicken not typically consumed by humans in Western cultures, including organs (liver, heart, kidney, spleen), necks, feet, and intestines. AAFCO defines chicken by-products as "non-rendered, clean parts of slaughtered chicken such as heads, feet, viscera, free from fecal content and foreign matter." This includes some of the most nutrient-dense parts of the animal, like liver (50x more vitamin A than muscle meat) and heart (rich in taurine and CoQ10).</div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Are chicken by-products bad for dogs?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">No, chicken by-products are not inherently bad for dogs. Many by-products (liver, heart, kidney, gizzard) are actually more nutrient-dense than muscle meat. The issue is lack of transparency—"chicken by-products" can include highly nutritious organs or lower-value parts like feet and necks, and you can't tell which from the label. Quality varies widely between manufacturers. Premium by-products from a trustworthy source can be excellent nutrition, while low-quality by-products from unknown sources are concerning.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">What is the difference between chicken and chicken by-products?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">"Chicken" on a dog food label means clean muscle meat and skin, with or without bone. "Chicken by-products" means organs, feet, heads, necks, intestines, and other parts not included in the "chicken" definition. Nutritionally, some by-products (organs like liver and heart) are far superior to plain muscle meat in vitamins, minerals, and amino acids. The main difference is transparency: "chicken" is specific and clear, while "chicken by-products" is vague and could include anything from premium liver to low-value feet.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">What is chicken by-product meal?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">Chicken by-product meal is chicken by-products (organs, necks, feet, heads) that have been rendered—cooked at high heat (240-290°F) to remove moisture and fat, then ground into a dry powder. It's similar to chicken meal but made from by-products instead of muscle meat. Rendering concentrates protein (60-70% protein vs 18-20% in fresh chicken) but damages heat-sensitive nutrients like B vitamins and taurine. Chicken by-product meal is less transparent and generally lower quality than named organ ingredients like "chicken liver" or "chicken heart."</div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Why are chicken by-products cheap?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">Chicken by-products are cheap because they're the parts of the chicken that Western consumers don't typically eat. In the US, people prefer boneless, skinless chicken breast, so organs, feet, necks, and heads have lower market value and are sold to pet food manufacturers at a discount. This doesn't necessarily mean by-products are low quality—many cultures prize organs for their nutritional value. The low cost reflects market demand, not inherent nutritional worth. However, the cheapness does attract manufacturers who prioritize cost-cutting over nutrition.</div>

        <div class="faq-question">Are organs considered by-products?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">Yes, organs like liver, heart, kidney, spleen, and gizzard are classified as by-products under AAFCO definitions because they're not muscle meat. This is one reason the by-product stigma is misleading—some of the most nutrient-dense parts of the animal (especially liver, which has 50x more vitamin A, 3000% more B12, and 12x more iron than muscle meat) are technically by-products. The issue isn't whether something is a by-product, but whether the manufacturer specifies which organs (transparent) or hides behind the vague term "by-products" (not transparent).</div>

        <div class="faq-question">Is chicken liver a by-product?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">Yes, chicken liver is technically a by-product since it's not muscle meat. However, when a food label lists "chicken liver" specifically (rather than "chicken by-products"), it's transparent and high-quality. Chicken liver is one of the most nutrient-dense foods available: 50x more vitamin A than muscle meat, 3000% more B12, 12x more iron, and extremely rich in folate, choline, and riboflavin. Named liver is excellent nutrition—vague "by-products" that might or might not include liver are the concern.</div>

        <div class="faq-question">Should I avoid dog food with chicken by-products?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">It depends on transparency and trust. Avoid foods that list vague "chicken by-products" without specifying what's included, especially from brands with poor quality reputations. Look for foods that name specific organs (chicken liver, chicken heart) instead of hiding behind generic "by-products." If a premium brand you trust lists by-products and provides transparency about sourcing, it may be fine. The issue isn't by-products themselves—it's manufacturers using the vague term to obscure low-quality ingredients.</div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">What are chicken by-products used for in dog treats?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">In dog treats, chicken by-products often refer to dehydrated or rendered organs, feet, necks, or cartilage. Some by-product treats are excellent: dehydrated chicken liver, heart, or gizzard are nutrient-dense and dogs love them. Others are low-value: chicken feet or necks provide collagen but little else. The problem is the label "chicken by-products" doesn't tell you which parts you're getting. Look for treats that specify the ingredient: "freeze-dried chicken liver" is transparent and trustworthy, while "chicken by-products" is vague and concerning.</div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Why do premium dog foods avoid by-products?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">Premium dog foods often avoid the term "by-products" for marketing reasons, not nutritional ones. The pet food industry has successfully stigmatized by-products as "fillers" or "waste," so premium brands avoid the term to appeal to consumers—even though many by-products (organs) are nutritionally superior to muscle meat. Instead, premium brands list specific organs like "beef liver," "chicken heart," or "turkey gizzard" rather than using the catch-all term "by-products." This provides transparency and avoids the negative association, even though these named organs are technically by-products.</div>
