# Ingredients to Update in Index Page

The following ingredients were consolidated and removed from the database. You'll need to update the ingredient index page to remove links to these ingredients (they now redirect automatically):

## Removed Ingredients (Now Redirect to Main Pages)

1. **Sodium Chloride** → redirects to Salt
2. **Iron Sulfate** → redirects to Ferrous Sulfate
3. **Camellia Sinensis** → redirects to Green Tea Extract
4. **Niacin Supplement** → redirects to Niacin
5. **Riboflavin Supplement** → redirects to Riboflavin
6. **Vitamin K1 Supplement** → redirects to Vitamin K1
7. **Alginic Acid** → redirects to Sodium Alginate
8. **Calcium D-pantothenate** → redirects to Calcium Pantothenate

## What to Do

If you have an ingredient index page (like an alphabetical list of all ingredients), you should:
1. Remove these 8 ingredients from the list
2. Keep only the main ingredient names (Salt, Ferrous Sulfate, Green Tea Extract, etc.)
3. The redirects will handle anyone who tries to access the old URLs

## Note

These ingredients still exist as **aliases** in the main ingredient data, so the ingredient analyzer tool will still recognize them when parsing ingredient lists. Users just won't see them listed as separate ingredients on the index page.
